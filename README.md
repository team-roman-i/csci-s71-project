# First Sprint

## Sprint planning
- Forecast: 15 story points for the first print
  - Reason: For the first sprint planning, we planned to finish the basic set up of the infrascture, in term of developer task, including the setup of                front server, setup webAPI, setup database for the web page. Thoses are all the basic setup, to make sure the additional features could be                built based on it. There are four developers in the team. In total, it would be 15 story points.
